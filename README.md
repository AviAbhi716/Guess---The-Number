# Guess-The Number Game

This is a fun and interactive number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 50. The game provides two difficulty levels:

ðŸ”¹ Easy Mode â€“ 10 attempts
ðŸ”¹ Hard Mode â€“ 5 attempts

How It Works:
1. The game starts with a welcome banner and asks the player to choose a difficulty level ('easy' or 'hard').
2. A random number between 1 and 50 is generated.
3. The player makes a guess, and the game provides hints:
     a. "Too low" if the guessed number is smaller than the target.
     b. "Too high" if the guessed number is greater than the target.
     c. "You win" if the guess is correct.
4. The player continues guessing until they run out of attempts or guess correctly.
5. If the player runs out of attempts, they lose, and the correct number is not revealed (which makes it more challenging!).

This game is a great way to test your number-guessing skills and improve your ability to think strategically! ðŸŽ¯
